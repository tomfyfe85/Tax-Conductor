# Tax-Conductor

**AI-powered tax calculator designed for professional musicians**

Simplifying complex tax scenarios for musicians juggling multiple income streams (gig income, royalties, expenses, PAYE income).

## Problem

Musicians often struggle to:

- Track income from multiple sources (gigs, royalties, teaching, session work)
- Understand tax deductions specific to the music industry
- File accurate tax returns without hiring expensive accountants

## Solution

Tax-Conductor uses AI to help musicians understand their tax obligations and optimize deductions in one place.
